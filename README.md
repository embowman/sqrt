# Square Root Algorithm

This is the result of a speck of curiosity in algorithms for finding
square roots. I've performed some light research and realized how decrepit
my math skills have become ðŸ˜‚

In the provided examples, I've arbitrarily decided to search
for a whole number that when squared is less than one quadrillion:
- 31,622,776^2 = 999,999,961,946,176

One could naively iterate through every number until that number squared
equals the radicand, but we can easily improve upon that with a simple
binary search. The binary method takes 51 iterations to find this
square root, which is obviously much better than the naive approach.
Newton's method improves this even further, requiring only 31 iterations.
Finally, Halley's method solves the problem with only 20 iterations.
